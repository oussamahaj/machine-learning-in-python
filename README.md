Regression analysis is one of the most widely used methods for prediction. Linear regression is probably the most
fundamental machine learning method out there and a starting point for the advanced analytical learning path of
every aspiring data scientist.
A linear regression is a linear approximation of a causal relationship between two or more variables.
Regression models are highly valuable, as they are one of the most common ways to make inferences and
predictions. Apart from this, regression analysis is also employed to determine and assess factors that affect a
certain outcome in a meaningful way.
As many other statistical techniques, regression models help us make predictions about the population based on
sample data.
